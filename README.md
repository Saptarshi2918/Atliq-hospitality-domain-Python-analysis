### **Executive Summary: Hospitality Data Analysis**

#### **Objective**
The analysis aimed to explore, clean, and derive insights from a property booking dataset to understand booking patterns, occupancy rates, revenue trends, and property performance across different cities and room categories.

---

### **Key Activities Performed**

#### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Unique Property Identification**: Identified all unique property IDs to understand the dataset scope.
   - **Booking Volume Analysis**: Calculated total bookings per property to assess popularity and demand.
   - **Capacity vs. Booking Analysis**: Flagged days where bookings exceeded property capacity—critical for operational insights.
   - **Capacity Ranking**: Identified properties with the highest capacity to understand scale and potential revenue ceilings.

#### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - **Invalid Guest Entries**: Removed or corrected records with invalid guest counts to ensure data accuracy.
   - **Revenue Outlier Treatment**: Identified and handled outliers in revenue data to prevent skewed analysis and modeling.

#### 3. **Data Transformation**
   - Created a new derived column: **`OCC_PCT`** (Occupancy Percentage), which measures the ratio of bookings to capacity—a key metric for performance evaluation.

#### 4. **Insight Generation**
   - **Occupancy by Room Category**: Calculated average occupancy rates for different room types to identify which categories are most in demand.
   - **City-wise Occupancy**: Compared average occupancy across cities to gauge regional performance.
   - **Weekday vs. Weekend Performance**: Analyzed whether occupancy was higher on weekdays or weekends—useful for pricing and staffing strategies.
   - **June Occupancy Trends**: Focused on occupancy rates in June across different cities to understand seasonal or monthly patterns.

### **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (as evidenced by the exported HTML structure and inline plots)
- **Data Visualization**: Bar charts and other plots to visually communicate findings.

---

### **Business Implications**
- **Operational Efficiency**: Identifying overbooked days helps in capacity planning and avoiding customer dissatisfaction.
- **Revenue Management**: Understanding occupancy trends by city, room type, and time helps in dynamic pricing and promotional strategies.
- **Strategic Decision-Making**: Insights into peak booking periods (weekends vs. weekdays, June trends) support better resource allocation and marketing focus.

---

### **Next Steps (If Applicable)**
- Predictive modeling for future occupancy and revenue forecasting.
- Customer segmentation analysis to tailor marketing efforts.
- Integration with external data (e.g., events, holidays) to deepen contextual insights.
